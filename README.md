## Description

 - A CSP involves finding solutions to a problem where variables must satisfy certain constraints. Based on DFS.
 - CSPs are represented by a set of variables, a scope for each variable, and constraints that specify allowable combinations of values for sets of variables.
 - This Python program implements Constraint Satisfaction through means of assigning unique number values to each variable from the given domain.
